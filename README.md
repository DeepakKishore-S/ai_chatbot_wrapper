## Installation

To use `ai_chatbot_wrapper` in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

### 1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file

In your `pubspec.yaml`, add the following dependency:

#### Using Git (for remote repositories):

```yaml
dependencies:
  ai_chatbot_wrapper:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/your_username/ai_chatbot_wrapper.git  # Replace with your GitHub URL
```

✅ **Key fix**: Ensure you're wrapping the YAML section **inside a Markdown code block** with triple backticks and `yaml` as the language specifier.

Would you like help formatting the rest of your README?

#### Using Local Path (for local development/testing):

```yaml
dependencies:
  ai_chatbot_wrapper:
    path: ../path_to_your_package  # Replace with the path to your local package

Then, run the following command in your terminal to fetch the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Configure Your OpenAI API Key (for real AI service)

If you're using the OpenAI service, you will need an API key from OpenAI. You can obtain it from [OpenAI API Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).

Once you have your API key, you can use the `OpenAIService` class to interact with the OpenAI API like so:

```dart
OpenAIService(apiKey: "your-api-key")
```

If you don't have an API key or want to use a mock AI service for local testing, you can use the `MockAIService` instead.

### 3. Example Usage

Once you’ve installed the package and configured the API key, you can start using the chatbot in your Flutter app. Here's an example of how to integrate the `ChatBotView` into your app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ai_chatbot_wrapper/ai_chatbot_wrapper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("AI Chatbot Example")),
        body: ChatBotView(
          sendMessage: OpenAIService(apiKey: "your-api-key").sendMessage,  // Use your OpenAI API key here
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### 4. Using the Mock AI Service (for local testing):

If you don’t have an API key or just want to test locally, you can use the mock service to simulate AI responses:

```dart
ChatBotView(
  sendMessage: MockAIService().sendMessage,  // Use mock service for local testing
)
```

### 5. Customizing the Chatbot UI

You can customize the UI to match your app’s design. You can modify the message styles, loading indicators, and more. Here’s an example:

```dart
ChatBotView(
  sendMessage: OpenAIService(apiKey: "your-api-key").sendMessage,
  messageStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 16),  // Customize message style
  loadingWidget: Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
    child: Text('Assistant is typing...', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16)),  // Customize loading indicator
  ),
)
```

### 6. Full Customization

- **sendMessage**: The function you pass into the `ChatBotView`. You can use either the `OpenAIService` for real AI interactions or `MockAIService` for local testing.
- **messageStyle**: Customize the text style for the messages (e.g., font size, color).
- **loadingWidget**: Customize the loading indicator. Instead of a circular spinner, you can show a "typing..." effect or an animation.

## Configuration Options

- **sendMessage**: This is the core function used for sending messages to the AI. It accepts a list of `Message` objects and returns a response as a string. Use the real OpenAI service for live chat or mock service for local development.
  
- **messageStyle**: Customize the text appearance of the messages exchanged between the user and the chatbot.
  
- **loadingWidget**: Replace the default loading spinner with your custom loading indicator or message (e.g., a typing effect).

## Example Screenshots

- **Real Chatbot (with OpenAI GPT)**: The chat interface powered by OpenAI GPT, displaying real responses from the AI.
- **Mock Chatbot**: The mock service, simulating responses for testing and development.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Failed to connect to OpenAI API"**: Make sure you have a valid API key from OpenAI, and check your account’s usage and quota.
- **"Error: Insufficient quota"**: Verify that your OpenAI account has sufficient API credits or usage left for the current billing cycle.
